    <p>You decide to raid the place by yourself.</p>
    <p>"Very well rest a few days while I get everything put together for you. Finding information takes time and I need to get new equipment for you to use."</p>
    After two weeks Liz comes to the place she set up for you with some equipment.
    "Here you go a set of leather so you can blend into the night, a sword that slows whoever is cut by it, and-" Now she unrolls a scroll. "-a map to the nearest base for you to raid."
    You thank her, put on the equipment, and set off immediately for the base. After another week you finally get there to stop Blackfang for now.</p>
