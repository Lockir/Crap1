      <p>You are Dan, a dark elf specializing in potions and herbal remedies.
      One day you recieve a letter asking for a highly illegal drug that only dark elves can make.
      You ignore the letter until one day after selling potions you return home in the evening, to find your wife the high priestess freshly murdered as five people stand around her.
      The people don't notice you until you run into the forest, and they follow in hot pursuit. </p>
