      <p>You are a Dan a dank elf specializing in potions and herbal remedies.
      One day you recieve a letter asking for a highly illegal drug that only dark elves can make.
      You ignore the letter until one day after selling potions you return home in the evening to find your wife freshly murdered as five people stand around her.
      The people don't notice you until you leave the house as you run into the forest with them still following you. </p>
