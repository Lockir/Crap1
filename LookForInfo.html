    <p>You decide to meet your old friend Liz after all she always seems to know what's going on in town. You travel to her house and open the door with your extra key.
    "Don't you know that entering without knocking is rude?" you hear immediately after opening the door with Liz pointing a gun in your face.
    You show her your face. "Oh Dan you're alive I heard about your wife and I thought you died as well!" You ask her about Blackfang and her face turns dark.
    "They're the ones who were behind that no wonder I can't find any details about what happened! Please run away they're a group trying to destroy the country!"
    You respond with a shake of your head ans ask for information about Blackfang's leader.
    So you won't change your mind very well are you going by yourself or can i come in with you?"</p>
