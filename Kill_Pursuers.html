    <p>You manage to kill some of the pursuers, but the rest overpower you and knock you unconscious. When you wake up, you are alone in the forest with the corpses of those you killed. One of the corpses has a sword and the other a sack of gold in its back pocket. Do you choose to take the gold or the sword?</p>
