    <p>You manage to kill two of the pursuers, but the rest overpower you and stab you in the chest, with one saying "That's for not listening to us, the Black Fang."
    and leaves you to die.
    When you wake up, you are alone in the forest at night with the corpses of those you killed. 
    You search around for herbs to help your wound, tear some cloth from the pursuers for bandages, and then look at what they had.
    One of the corpses has a sword, and the other a sack of gold in its back pocket and a broken bow.
    Do you choose to take the gold or the sword?</p>
