      <p>You keep running, hoping to outrun the people chasing after you. However an arrow pierces your shoulder and another pierces your leg, causing you to fall.
      The people catch up to you, with one saying "Poor fool. Don't know what the boss wants you dead for but -" *He kicks you sharply*
      "- I ain't gonna ask!" </p>
